                  It's always a good market in real estate, when you know what you're doing. 
                  Structuring transactions, arranging financing and finding the right buyers are some of the 
                  keys to success. There are few entities that know as much about the trends in today's 
                  market as your local real estate agent or broker.
                  Real estate has become a very complicated business. Selling (or buying) a home can be 
                  one of the most important financial transactions in your life. That's why it pays to work 
                  with a professional who specializes in this field, a licensed real estate agent or broker.
                  Becoming a licensed agent or broker requires thorough training and examination. 
                  Several states require continuing education in real estate for license renewal. 
                  These specialists are compensated on their ability to sell properties quickly and 
                  cost-efficiently, and their expert abilities are chargeable only when a transaction 
                  is complete.

                  For most of us, a home is the single biggest purchase in our lives. 
                  The enormity of the financial transaction aside, finding the right home to fit 
                  our particular needs and wants is no easy undertaking. Just as you wouldn't buy a car, 
                  computer or camcorder without doing some research into various models and prices, 
                  you shouldn't consider purchasing a home without some expert advice and guidance. 
                  Though some people may think of using the services of a REALTOR® only when selling their 
                  homes, a REALTOR® can be invaluable when buying one as well.

                <p>
                  You probably know that working with a REALTOR® is an indispensable part of selling your home. 
                  For one thing, your REALTOR® can list your property in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), 
                  providing your home with incomparable exposure and ensuring you have as many REALTORS® as 
                  possible helping to find a buyer. But that's not all a REALTOR® does to market your home. 
                  He or she knows how to specifically target advertising to reach buyers for your home, and uses 
                  all the marketing tools available to ensure that your home is sold expediently. Additionally, 
                  a REALTOR® conducts a variety of other marketing efforts on your behalf, from holding open 
                  houses and handling phone inquiries to showing your home to the prospective buyers.
